<h2>Backstory</h2>
<div class="white-container">
    <p>
        It all began when I started working at an organization two years ago as an intern..
        <br>
        <br>
        I was tasked to create and name folders according to the number of expenses of that month
        It was a bunch ranging in the hundreds. And it took over an hour to finalize, the correct names,
        amounts, currencies, invoice numbers, etc..
        I wouldn't say it was difficult but definetly boring. And I could've instead done more productive stuff.
        <br>
        I just knew there was an easier way to automate that task.. but i didn't know how but I was curious enough to
        search for the answer.
        I used excel to print MDs (Make directorate) for each entry and pasted them into a bat file to execute.
        <br>
        And boom. this whole thing took about 8 seconds.
        <br>
        And so I thought of better ways to build it more efficiently and I discovered the power of python.
        <br>
        From then on I took the cs50x course which taught me most of what I know now about algorithms and how computers
        work.
        <br>
        <br>
    <p>I had thought of programming before but never really understood why people do it and how they find joy doing it.
        But now that I know the reason, I cannot even think of stopping.
        <br><br>
        That's when I realized, I love problem solving.
        <br>
        And in turn, programming.
